The IP address on the NDMP server that receives the incoming request from the DMA decides the scope and precedence for setting thepreference. If the incoming IP address is within a subnet scope that has a preference, then the preference setting is applied. If a subnet-specific preference does not exist but a cluster-wide preference exists, the cluster-wide preference setting is applied. Subnet-specificpreference always overrides the cluster-wide preference. If both the cluster-wide and subnet-specific preferences do not exist, the IPaddresses within the subnet of the IP address receiving the incoming requests from the DMA are used as the preferred IP addresses.You can have one preferred IP setting per cluster or per network subnet.
